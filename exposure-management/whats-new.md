## November 2024

### Announcing the General Availability of Microsoft Security Exposure Management

We are excited to announce the general availability of Microsoft Security Exposure Management. This powerful tool helps organizations focus on their most critical exposures and act swiftly. By integrating security insights across the entire digital estate, it provides a comprehensive view of risk posture, enabling faster, more informed decisions to reduce exposure before attackers can exploit it.

With this GA release, you can now build and enhance a Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) program, continuously identifying, prioritizing, and mitigating risks across your digital landscape.

### Attack path enhancements

##### **Hybrid attack paths: On-Prem to Cloud**

We now support the discovery and visualization of hybrid attack paths that originate from on-premises environments and traverse into cloud infrastructures. We have introduced a new **Type column** for the attack paths to display the support for hybrid paths that transition between
on-premises and cloud environments, or vice versa. This feature equips security teams to:

- **Identify cross-environment attack vectors:** See how vulnerabilities in on-prem environments can be leveraged to target assets in the cloud.
- **Prioritize remediation effectively:** Gain clarity on the potential risks to critical cloud assets stemming from your hybrid infrastructure.
- **Enhance hybrid defense strategies:** Use these insights to strengthen both on-prem and cloud security postures.

This capability bridges a critical gap in securing hybrid environments by offering end-to-end visibility into interconnected attack paths.

##### **DACL-based path analysis**

Our attack path calculations now include support for **Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs)**, providing a more accurate representation of potential attack paths by incorporating group-based permissions. This enhancement enables defenders to:

- Make more informed decisions when addressing risks related to permission structures.
- View risks in the environment the same way attackers do
- Identify low hanging fruit chokepoints that significantly expose the environment to risk
 
For more information, see, [Review attack paths](review-attack-paths.md)

### External data connectors

We have introduced new external data connectors to enhance data integration capabilities, allowing seamless ingestion of security data from other security vendors.  Data collected through these connectors is normalized within our exposure graph, enhancing your device inventory, mapping relationships, and revealing new attack paths for comprehensive attack surface visibility. These connectors help you to consolidate security posture data from various sources, providing a comprehensive view of your security posture.

For more information, see [Data connectors overview](overview-data-connectors.md).

### Discovery sources available in the inventory and attack surface map

The Device Inventory and Attack Surface Map now display the data sources for each discovered asset. This feature provides an overview of which tools or products reported each asset, including Microsoft and external connectors like Tenable or ServiceNow CMDB. In the inventory, use the **Discovery Sources** column to filter devices by reporting sources. In the **Attack Surface Map**, toggle the **Discovery Sources** view using the **Layers** option. You can also query **Discovery Sources** in the **Device Info** table via Advanced Hunting.

For more information on understanding data from external sources, see [Getting value from your data connectors](value-data-connectors.md)

### OT security initiative

The new Operational Technology (OT) security initiative equips practitioners with a powerful tool to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks across the OT environment, ensuring both operational reliability and safety. This initiative aims to identify devices across physical sites, assess their associated risks, and provide faster, more effective protection for OT systems.

For more information, see, [Review security initiatives](initiatives.md)

### Microsoft Security Exposure Management is now supported in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control (RBAC)

Access control to Microsoft Security Exposure Management can now be managed using Microsoft Defender XDR Unified Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions model with dedicated and granular permissions.

This new capability enables admins to grant their posture managers with access to Exposure Management data and experiences with the least privilege access approach rather than the Microsoft Azure Entra ID roles, which is still supported and can be used if needed.

To learn more about Microsoft Security Exposure Management access management using Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC permissions model, see [Prerequisites and support](/security-exposure-management/prerequisites). 

To learn more about creating new custom roles in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC, see [Create custom roles in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC](/defender-xdr/create-custom-rbac-roles).

### Content versioning notifications

The new versioning feature in Microsoft Security Exposure Management offers proactive notifications about upcoming version updates, giving users advanced visibility into anticipated metric changes and their impact on their related initiatives. A dedicated side panel provides comprehensive details about each update, including the expected release date, release notes, current and new metric values, and any changes to related initiative scores. Additionally, users can share direct feedback on the updates within the platform, fostering continuous improvement and responsiveness to user needs.

For more information on exposure insights, see [Overview - Exposure insights](exposure-insights-overview.md)

### Exposure history for metrics

User can investigate metric changes by reviewing the asset exposure change details. From the initiative's **History** tab, by selecting a specific metric, you can now see the list of assets where exposure has been either added or removed, providing clearer insight into exposure shifts over time.

For more information, see, [Reviewing initiative history](exposure-insights-overview.md#reviewing-initiative-history)

### SaaS security initiative

The SaaS Security initiative delivers a clear view of your SaaS security coverage, health, configuration, and performance. Through metrics spanning multiple domains, it gives security managers a high-level understanding of their SaaS security posture.

For more information, see, [SaaS security initiative](/defender-cloud-apps/saas-security-initiative)

## October 2024

### New in attack paths

We have introduced four new features designed to enhance your security management and risk mitigation efforts. These features provide valuable insights into the attack paths identified within your environment, enabling you to prioritize risk mitigation strategies effectively and reduce the impact of potential threats.

The new features include:

- **Attack path widget on exposure management overview page**: Provides users with an at-a-glance, high-level view of discovered attack paths. It displays a timeline of newly identified paths, key entry points, target types, and more, ensuring security teams stay informed about emerging threats and can respond quickly.
- **Attack path dashboard**: Provides a high-level overview of all identified attack paths within the environment. This feature enables security teams to gain valuable insights into the types of paths identified, top entry points, target assets, and more, helping to prioritize risk mitigation efforts effectively.
- **Choke points**: Highlights critical assets that multiple attack paths intersect, identifying them as key vulnerabilities within the environment. By focusing on these choke points, security teams can efficiently reduce risk by addressing high-impact assets, thus preventing attackers from progressing through various paths.
- **Blast radius**: Allows users to visually explore the paths from a choke point. It provides a detailed visualization showing how the compromise of one asset could affect others, enabling security teams to assess the broader implications of an attack and prioritize mitigation strategies more effectively.
