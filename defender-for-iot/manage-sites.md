# Manage sites

Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Microsoft Defender portal includes the **Site security** page, which allows you to see the up-to-date security state of your production sites. Learn more about the [site security benefits and use cases](site-security-overview.md) or the [**Site security** page](monitor-site-security.md).

When you manage a site, you might need to edit or delete the site information listed in the **Site security** page.

## Manually update device site association

Security admininstrators can manually assign or modify the site location for a device. Manually assigning a site overrides the automatic site association created when making the site. Therefore, once a site is set manually, this device <!-- surely: once the device is set manually, it will no longer.... AMIT? --> will no longer appear in the automatic site association suggestions in the Site set up process, until the manual association is reset.<!-- why do i need to add this, if the device is already associated with a site, why would it appear in a list anyway? Amit -->

To quickly update a group of devices, select multiple devices from the inventory and set the site for all of the selected devices simulataneously.<!-- The 'Set site' action can be used for bulk management by selecting multiple devices from the inventory and setting the site for all selected devices simultaneously. This allows for quick updates to site associations when managing a group of devices. this was Amits wording, i think this is better. but should i use the words bulk management? Should this be added at the end instead of the beginning? Limor-->

**To change the site associated with a device**:

1. Select **Assets -> Devices** to open the **Device Inventory**.
1. Select the device, or group of devices, to update. A list of action buttons appear at the top of the Device Inventory table.
1. Select **Set site**. The **Set site** pane opens.

1. In **Set site manually**, open the **Select site** drop down list and select the site to associate with this device. If you want to leave a device unassociated with a specific site, select **Unassigned**.

1. Select **Save and close**.
1. The Set site confirmation box appears. Select **Confirm** to finalize the change. Finalizing the change prevents automatic site reassignment based on existing site security rules. This change remains until the device is reset manually.

Alternatively, for managing multiple device or making site wide changes, it is recommended to go to **Site security** and use the **Edit site** wizard to more efficiently manage the site and the devices associated to it. For more information, see [Site security](monitor-site-security.md). <!-- but this is more like removing a device from a specific site, not adding it to a different one instead?? how is this different from the bulk management mentioned above? AMIT-->

## Edit or delete a site

To edit or delete a site:

1. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/machines) menu, select **Operational technology** > **Site security**.
1. Select the ellipsis (:::image type="icon" source="media/manage-sites/menu-ellipsis.png" alt-text="menu vertical ellipsis button":::) to the right of the site name.
1. Select one of the following:

    - Select **Edit site** to open the **Site details** pane, where you can make changes to the site. For more information, see [Site details](set-up-sites.md).
    - Select **Delete site** to remove a site from the site list. This deletes all site-related information for the associated devices.

## Add device group

You can create a device group based on a site location to restrict access to a specific site or group of sites, and verify that the correct users have access to your site.

You can set up a device group at different stages:

- To set up a device group as part of the site setup, see [Add a device group](set-up-sites.md#add-device-group).
- To set up a device group after you set up a site, see [Create and manage device groups](/defender-endpoint/machine-groups).

To get the full benefit of the device group, you might need to create roles and permission settings. For more information, see:

- [Role based access control in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/rbac) 
- [Create and manage roles in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/user-roles)
