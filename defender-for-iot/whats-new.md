## December 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **Site security** | - [Secure site-linked devices in Microsoft Security Exposure Management Initiatives page](#secure-site-linked-devices-in-microsoft-security-exposure-management-initiatives-page) |

### Site association search in Site security page now supports various device types

To support searching across all relevant sites and device types, the **Site security** > **Associate devices** page now supports searching for various device types, including IT, enterprise IoT, and network devices.

The suggested sites list now shows all relevant sites that match the search criteria across all device types. When you expand each site, you can view all relevant devices under the site, including the device name and type.

## November 2024

|Service area  |Updates  |

| **Devices** | - [Secure site-linked devices in Microsoft Security Exposure Management Initiatives page](#secure-site-linked-devices-in-microsoft-security-exposure-management-initiatives-page) |

### Secure site-linked devices in Microsoft Security Exposure Management Initiatives page

You can now review the new **OT Security** initiative in the Microsoft Security Exposure Management **Initiatives** page. This new initiative provides a metric-driven way of tracking exposure about unmanaged OT devices.

This new initiative serves as a powerful tool to improve your OT site security posture. The initiative aims to monitor and safeguard OT environments within the organization by employing network layer monitoring. This initiative identifies devices and ensures that systems are working correctly, and data is protected.

### New Building Management Systems (BMS) device category

We now support the new BMS device category in Defender for IoT that improves BMS device discovery and security. The BMS category includes a subset of Smart Facility and Surveillance devices (previously under the IoT category) such as fire alarms, humidity sensors, security radars, etc. Camera devices remain under the IoT category.

For more information, see [overview of device discovery](device-discovery.md).
