# Data security and retention in Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

Microsoft Defender XDR integrates with several different Microsoft security services, which collect data using various technologies. Integrated services allow Microsoft Defender XDR to access their data for the purpose of identifying cross-product correlations.

## Collected data

Customer data collected from integrated services includes *processed data*, such as incidents and alerts, and *configuration data*, such as connector settings, rules and so on.

## Data storage location

Microsoft Defender XDR operatins in Microsoft Azure data centers in the following geographical regions:

- Australia
- European Union
- India
- Switzerland
- United Kingdom
- United States

Once created, the Microsoft Defender XDR tenant isn't movable to a different region. Your geographical region is shown in the Microsoft Defender portal, under **Settings > Microsoft Defender XDR > Account**.

Customer data stored by integrated services might also be stored in the following locations:

- The original location for the relevant service.
- A region defined by data storage rules of an integrated serice, if Microsoft Defender XDR shares data with that service.

## Data retention

Microsoft Defender XDR data is retained for 180 days, and is visible across the Microsoft Defender portal during that time, except for in **Advanced hunting** queries. 

In the Microsoft Defender portal's **Advanced hunting** page, data is accessible via queries for only 30 days, unless it's streamed through [Microsoft's unified security operations platform with Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/microsoft-365-defender-sentinel-integration?toc=%2Fdefender-xdr%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fdefender-xdr%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&tabs=defender-portal&view=o365-worldwide), where retention periods may be longer.

Data continues to be retained and visible, even when a license is under a grace period or in supspended mode. At the end of any grace period or suspension, and no later than 180 days from a contract termination or expiration, data is deleted from Microsoft's systems and is unrecoverable.

The following table provides data retention periods for other services available in the Microsoft Defender portal. See the relevant service docs for detailed information.
