This article describes how to install, configure, update, and use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux.

> [!CAUTION]
> Running other non-Microsoft endpoint protection products alongside Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux is likely to lead to performance problems and unpredictable side effects. If non-Microsoft endpoint protection is an absolute requirement in your environment, you can still safely take advantage of Defender for Endpoint on Linux EDR functionality after configuring antivirus functionality to run in [Passive mode](linux-preferences.md#enforcement-level-for-antivirus-engine).

## How to install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux includes anti-malware and endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities.

### Prerequisites

If you experience any installation failures, see [Troubleshooting installation failures in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](linux-support-install.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in any location other than the default install path is not supported.
> Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux creates an `mdatp` user with random UID and GID. If you want to control the UID and GID, create an `mdatp` user prior to installation using the  `/usr/sbin/nologin` shell option. Here's an example: `mdatp:x:UID:GID::/home/mdatp:/usr/sbin/nologin`.

### System requirements

- Disk space: 2 GB

  > [!NOTE]
  > An additional 2 GB disk space might be needed if cloud diagnostics are enabled for crash collections. Please make sure that you have free disk space in /var.

- Cores: Two minimum, four preferred

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you are on Passive or RTP ON mode, at least two Cores are required. Four Cores are preferred. If you are turning on BM, then at least four Cores are required.

- Memory: 1 GB minimum, 4 GB preferred

  > [!NOTE]
  > Distributions and version that are not explicitly listed are unsupported (even if they are derived from the officially supported distributions).
  > After a new package version is released, support for the previous two versions is reduced to technical support only. Versions older than that which are listed in this section are provided for technical upgrade support only.
  > Microsoft Defender Vulnerablity Management is not supported on Rocky and Alma currently.
  > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for all other supported distributions and versions is kernel-version-agnostic. With a minimal requirement for the kernel version to be at or greater than 3.10.0-327.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > Running Defender for Endpoint on Linux side by side with other `fanotify`-based security solutions is not supported. It can lead to unpredictable results, including hanging the operating system. If there are any other applications on the system that use `fanotify` in blocking mode, applications are listed in the `conflicting_applications` field of the `mdatp health` command output. The Linux **FAPolicyD** feature uses `fanotify` in blocking mode, and is therefore unsupported when running Defender for Endpoint in active mode. You can still safely take advantage of Defender for Endpoint on Linux EDR functionality after configuring the antivirus functionality Real Time Protection Enabled to [Passive mode](linux-preferences.md#enforcement-level-for-antivirus-engine).

- /opt/microsoft/mdatp/sbin/wdavdaemon requires executable permission. For more information, see "Ensure that the daemon has executable permission" in [Troubleshoot installation issues for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](linux-support-install.md).

### External package dependency

If the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installation fails due to missing dependencies errors, you can manually download the prerequisite dependencies. The following external package dependencies exist for the mdatp package:

- The mdatp RPM package requires `glibc >= 2.17`, `audit`, `policycoreutils`, `semanage` `selinux-policy-targeted`, and `mde-netfilter`
- For RHEL6 the mdatp RPM package requires `audit`, `policycoreutils`, `libselinux`, and `mde-netfilter`
- For DEBIAN the mdatp package requires `libc6 >= 2.23`, `uuid-runtime`, `auditd`, and `mde-netfilter`

The mde-netfilter package also has the following package dependencies:

- For DEBIAN the mde-netfilter package requires `libnetfilter-queue1`, and `libglib2.0-0`
- For RPM the mde-netfilter package requires `libmnl`, `libnfnetlink`, `libnetfilter_queue`, and `glib2`

### Configuring Exclusions

When adding exclusions to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, you should be mindful of [Common Exclusion Mistakes for Microsoft Defender Antivirus](common-exclusion-mistakes-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

### Network connections

Ensure that connectivity is possible from your devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint cloud services. To prepare your environment, see [STEP 1: Configure your network environment to ensure connectivity with Defender for Endpoint service](configure-environment.md).

Defender for Endpoint on Linux can connect through a proxy server by using the following discovery methods:

- Transparent proxy
- Manual static proxy configuration

If a proxy or firewall is blocking anonymous traffic, make sure that anonymous traffic is permitted in the previously listed URLs. For transparent proxies, no another configuration is needed for Defender for Endpoint. For static proxy, follow the steps in [Manual Static Proxy Configuration](linux-static-proxy-configuration.md).

> [!WARNING]
> PAC, WPAD, and authenticated proxies are not supported. Ensure that only a static proxy or transparent proxy is being used.
> SSL inspection and intercepting proxies are also not supported for security reasons. Configure an exception for SSL inspection and your proxy server to directly pass through data from Defender for Endpoint on Linux to the relevant URLs without interception. Adding your interception certificate to the global store will not allow for interception.
