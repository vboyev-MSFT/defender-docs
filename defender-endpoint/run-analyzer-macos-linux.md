# Run the client analyzer on macOS and Linux

The XMDEClientAnalyzer is used for diagnosing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint health or reliability issues on onboarded devices running either Linux, or macOS.

There are two ways to run the client analyzer tool:

1. Using a binary version (no external Python dependency)
2. Using a Python-based solution

## Running the binary version of the client analyzer

1. Download the [XMDE Client Analyzer Binary](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2297517) tool to the macOS or Linux machine you need to investigate.\
If you're using a terminal, download the tool by entering the following command:

    ```bash
    wget --quiet -O XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2297517
    ```

1. Verify the download.

   - Linux

    ```bash
    echo '2A9BF0A6183831BE43C7BCB7917A40D772D226301B4CDA8EE4F258D00B6E4E97 XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip' | sha256sum -c
    ```

   - macOS

    ```bash
    echo '2A9BF0A6183831BE43C7BCB7917A40D772D226301B4CDA8EE4F258D00B6E4E97  XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip' | shasum -a 256 -c
    ```


2. Extract the contents of `XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip` on the machine. If you're using a terminal, extract the files by entering the following command:

    ```bash
    unzip -q XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary.zip -d XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary
    ```

3. Change to the tool's directory by entering the following command:

    ```bash
    cd XMDEClientAnalyzerBinary
    ```

4. Two new zip files are produced:

   - **SupportToolLinuxBinary.zip** : For all Linux devices
   - **SupportToolMacOSBinary.zip** : For Mac devices

5. Unzip one of the above 2 zip files based on the machine you need to investigate. When using a terminal, unzip the file by entering one of the following commands based on OS type:

   - Linux

     ```bash
     unzip -q SupportToolLinuxBinary.zip
     ```

   - Mac

     ```bash
     unzip -q SupportToolMacOSBinary.zip
     ```

6. Run the tool as _root_ to generate diagnostic package:

   ```bash
   sudo ./MDESupportTool -d
   ```

## Running the Python-based client analyzer

> [!NOTE]
> - The analyzer depends on few extra PIP packages (`decorator`, `sh`, `distro`, `lxml`, and `psutil`) which are installed in the operating system when in root to produce the result output. If not installed, the analyzer attempts to fetch it from the [official repository for Python packages](https://pypi.org/search/?q=lxml).
> - In addition, the tool currently requires Python version 3 or later to be installed on your device.
> - If your device is behind a proxy, then you can simply pass the proxy server as an environment variable to the `mde_support_tool.sh` script. For example: `https_proxy=https://myproxy.contoso.com:8080 ./mde_support_tool.sh"`.

> [!WARNING]
> Running the Python-based client analyzer requires the installation of PIP packages which may cause some issues in your environment. To avoid issues from occurring, it is recommended that you install the packages into a user PIP environment.

1. Download the [XMDE Client Analyzer](https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer) tool to the macOS or Linux machine you need to investigate. If you're using a terminal, download the tool by running the following command:

    ```bash
    wget --quiet -O XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer
    ```

2. Verify the download.

   - Linux

    ```bash
    echo '84C9718FF3D29DA0EEE650FB2FC0625549A05CD1228AC253DBB92C8B1D9F1D11 XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip' | sha256sum -c
    ```

   - macOS

    ```bash
    echo '84C9718FF3D29DA0EEE650FB2FC0625549A05CD1228AC253DBB92C8B1D9F1D11  XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip' | shasum -a 256 -c
    ```

3. Extract the contents of XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip on the machine. If you're using a terminal, extract the files by using the following command:

    ```bash
    unzip -q XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip -d XMDEClientAnalyzer
    ```

4. Change directory to the extracted location.

    ```bash
    cd XMDEClientAnalyzer
    ```

5. Give the tool executable permission.

    ```bash
    chmod a+x mde_support_tool.sh
    ```

6. Run as a non-root user to install required dependencies.

    ```bash
    ./mde_support_tool.sh
    ```

7. To collect actual diagnostic package and generate the result archive file, run again as root.

    ```bash
    sudo ./mde_support_tool.sh -d
    ```

                        Path to onboarding script
  -g GEO, --geo GEO     Geo string to test <US|UK|EU|AU|CH|IN>

```

Usage example: `sudo ./MDESupportTool connectivitytest -o ~/MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py`

The result will be printed in the screen.


#### Collect different installation/onboarding reports

This mode collects installation related info like disto info, system requirements, etc.

```console

  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -d, --distro  Check for distro support
  -a, --all     Run all checks

```

Usage example: `sudo ./MDESupportTool installation --all`

A single report `installation_report.json` is generated. The keys in the file are as:

| Key  | Remarks |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| agent_version  | Version of Defender for Endpoint installed  |
| onboarding_status | The onboarding and ring info |

#### Use OS trace (for macOS only)

Use OS tracing facilities to record Defender for Endpoint performance traces.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality exists in the Python solution only.

```console

-h, --help       show this help message and exit
--length LENGTH  Length of time to record the trace (in seconds).
--mask MASK      Mask to select with event to trace. Defaults to all

```

On running this command for the first time, it installs a Profile configuration.

Follow this to approve profile installation: [Apple Support Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/configuration-profiles-standardize-settings-mh35561/mac#:~:text=Install%20a%20configuration%20profile%20you%E2%80%99ve%20received).

Usage example `./mde_support_tool.sh trace --length 5`

#### Exclude mode

Add exclusions for audit-d monitoring.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality exists for Linux only.

```console

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e <executable>, --exe <executable>
                        exclude by executable name, i.e: bash
  -p <process id>, --pid <process id>
                        exclude by process id, i.e: 911
  -d <directory>, --dir <directory>
                        exclude by target path, i.e: /var/foo/bar
  -x <executable> <directory>, --exe_dir <executable> <directory>
                        exclude by executable path and target path, i.e: /bin/bash /var/foo/bar
  -q <q_size>, --queue <q_size>
                        set dispatcher q_depth size
  -r, --remove          remove exclusion file
  -s, --stat            get statistics about common executables
  -l, --list            list auditd rules
  -o, --override        Override the existing auditd exclusion rules file for mdatp
  -c <syscall number>, --syscall <syscall number>
                        exclude all process of the given syscall

```

Usage example: `sudo ./MDESupportTool exclude -d /var/foo/bar`

### AuditD Rate Limiter

Syntax that can be used to limit the number of events being reported by the auditD plugin. This option sets the rate limit globally for AuditD causing a drop in all the audit events. When the limiter is enabled the number of auditd events are limited to 2500 events/sec. This option can be used in cases where we see high CPU usage from AuditD side.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality exists for Linux only.

```console

-h, --help                                  show this help message and exit
-e <true/false>, --enable <true/false>      enable/disable the rate limit with default values

```

Usage example: `sudo ./mde_support_tool.sh ratelimit -e true`

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality should be carefully used as limits the number of events being reported by the auditd subsystem as a whole. This could reduces the number of events for other subscribers as well.

### AuditD Skip Faulty Rules

This option enables you to skip the faulty rules added in the auditd rules file while loading them. This option allows the auditd subsystem to continue loading rules even if there's a faulty rule. This option summarizes the results of loading the rules. In the background, this option runs the auditctl with the -c option.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is only available on Linux.

```console

-h, --help                                  show this help message and exit
-e <true/false>, --enable <true/false>      enable/disable the option to skip the faulty rules. In case no argumanet is passed, the option will be true by default.

```

Usage example: `sudo ./mde_support_tool.sh skipfaultyrules -e true`

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality will be skipping the faulty rules. The faulty rule then needs to be further identified and fixed.
