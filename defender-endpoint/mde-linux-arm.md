- Amazon Linux 2023 ARM64

> [!NOTE]
> Support for more Linux distributions is planned as part of this preview program.

## Deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux for ARM64-based devices

You can choose from several methods to deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux to your ARM64-based device:

- [Installer script](#deploy-using-the-installer-script)
- [Ansible](#deploy-using-the-installer-script-with-ansible)
- [Puppet](#deploy-using-the-installer-script-with-puppet)
- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](#deploy-defender-for-endpoint-on-linux-using-microsoft-defender-for-cloud)

### Before you begin

- Make sure the [prerequisites](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md#prerequisites) are met for Defender for Endpoint on Linux

- Make sure to install the agent version `101.24102.0002` from the insiders-slow channel on the ARM64-based device. (See [What's new in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](linux-whatsnew.md).) 

- To onboard servers to Defender for Endpoint, [server licenses](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#microsoft-defender-for-endpoint) are required. You can choose from these options:

   - Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2 (as part of the [Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction)) offering; or
   - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Server

### Deploy using the installer script

1. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Device management** > **Onboarding**.

     debug:
       msg: "{{ script_output.stderr }}"

   ```
   
5. Deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux by using the following command. Edit the corresponding paths and channel, as appropriate.

   ```bash
   
   ansible-playbook -i  /etc/ansible/hosts /etc/ansible/playbooks/install_mdatp.yml --extra-vars "onboarding_script=<path to mdatp_onboard.json > mde_installer_script=<path to mde_installer.sh> channel=<channel to deploy for: insiders-slow > "

   ```

6. Validate your deployment by following these steps:

   1. On the device, run the following commands to check for device health, connectivity, antivirus, and EDR detections:

      ```YAML

      - name: Run post-installation basic MDE test
        hosts: myhosts
        tasks:
    
         - name: Check health
           ansible.builtin.command: mdatp health --field healthy
           register: health_status

         - name: MDE health test failed
           fail: msg="MDE is not healthy. health status => \n{{ health_status.stdout       }}\nMDE deployment not complete"
           when: health_status.stdout != "true"

         - name: Run connectivity test
           ansible.builtin.command: mdatp connectivity test
           register: connectivity_status

         - name: Connectivity failed
           fail: msg="Connectivity failed. Connectivity result => \n{{ connectivity_status.stdout }}\n MDE deployment not complete"
           when: connectivity_status.rc != 0

         - name: Check RTP status
           ansible.builtin.command: mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
           register: rtp_status

         - name: Enable RTP
           ansible.builtin.command: mdatp config real-time-protection --value enabled
           become: yes
           become_user: root
           when: rtp_status.stdout != "true"

         - name: Pause for 5 second to enable RTP
           ansible.builtin.pause:
           seconds: 5

         - name: Download EICAR
           ansible.builtin.get_url:
           url: https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt
           dest: /tmp/eicar.com.txt

         - name: Pause for 5 second to detect eicar 
           ansible.builtin.pause:
           seconds: 5

         - name: Check for EICAR file
           stat: path=/tmp/eicar.com.txt
           register: eicar_test

         - name: EICAR test failed
           fail: msg="EICAR file not deleted. MDE deployment not complete"
           when: eicar_test.stat.exists

         - name: MDE Deployed
           debug:
           msg: "MDE succesfully deployed"

      ```

   2. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Assets** > **Devices**, look for the Linux device you just onboarded. It can take approximately 20 minutes for the device to show up in the portal.

7. If you run into an issue, see [Troubleshoot deployment issues](#troubleshoot-deployment-issues) (in this article).

### Deploy using the installer script with Puppet

1. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Device management** > **Onboarding**.

2. In the onboarding screen, select the following options:

   1. In the **Select operating system to start onboarding process** list, select **Linux Server**.

   2. In the **Connectivity type** list, select **Streamlined**. Or, if necessary, you can select **Standard**. (For more information, see [Onboarding devices using streamlined connectivity for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](configure-device-connectivity.md).)

   3. In the **Deployment method** list, select **Your preferred Linux configuration management tool**.

   4. Select **Download onboarding package**. Save the file as `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip`.

3. Extract the contents of the onboarding package by using the following command:

   `unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip`

   You should see the following output:

   ```
   Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
   inflating: mdatp_onboard.json
   ```

4. In a new browser window, download the [Defender for Endpoint installer bash script](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh) (this script is called `mde_installer.sh`).

5. Create a Puppet manifest by using the following procedure, which uses the `mde_installer.sh` script from step 4.

   1. In the **modules** folder of your Puppet installation, create the following folders:

      - `install_mdatp/files` 
      - `install_mdatp/manifests`
      
      The **modules** folder is typically located at `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules` on your Puppet server.

   2. Copy the `mdatp_onboard.json` file created earlier to the `install_mdatp/files` folder.

   3. Copy `mde_installer.sh` to `install_mdatp/files folder`.

   4. Create an `init.pp` file inside `install_mdatp/manifests` that contains the following deployment instructions:

      ```bash
      tree install_mdatp
      Output: 
      install_mdatp
      ├── files
      │   ├── mdatp_onboard.sh
      │   └── mde_installer.sh
      └── manifests
          └── init.pp
      ```

6. Use the Puppet manifest to install Defender for Endpoint on Linux on your device.

   ```bash
   
   # Puppet manifest to install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux.
   # @param channel The release channel based on your environment, insider-fast or prod.

   class install_mdatp (
     $channel = 'insiders-slow',
   ) {
     # Ensure that the directory /tmp/mde_install exists
     file { '/tmp/mde_install':
       ensure => directory,
       mode   => '0755',
     }

   # Copy the installation script to the destination
   file { '/tmp/mde_install/mde_installer.sh':
     ensure => file,
     source => 'puppet:///modules/install_mdatp/mde_installer.sh',
     mode   => '0777',
     }

   # Copy the onboarding script to the destination
   file { '/tmp/mde_install/mdatp_onboard.json':
    ensure => file,
    source => 'puppet:///modules/install_mdatp/mdatp_onboard.json',
    mode   => '0777',
    }

   #Install MDE on the host using an external script
   exec { 'install_mde':
    command     => "/tmp/mde_install/mde_installer.sh --install --channel ${channel} --onboard /tmp/mde_install/mdatp_onboard.json",
    path        => '/bin:/usr/bin',
    user        => 'root',
    logoutput   => true,
    require     => File['/tmp/mde_install/mde_installer.sh', '/tmp/mde_install/mdatp_onboard.json'], # Ensure the script is copied before running the installer
   }
   }
   ```

7. Validate your deployment. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Assets** > **Devices**, look for the Linux device you just onboarded. It can take approximately 20 minutes for the device to show up in the portal.

### Deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux using Microsoft Defender for Cloud

If your organization is using Defender for Cloud, you can use it to deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux.

1. We recommend enabling automatic deployment on your ARM64-based Linux devices. To enable automatic deployment, under `.bashrc` as a root user or `/etc/profile` on your device, set the environment variables as follows:

   - `OPT_FOR_MDE_ARM_PREVIEW=1`
   - `OPT_FOR_MDE_ARM_PREVIEW=true`

2. Wait for 1-6 hours for onboarding to complete.

3. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Assets** > **Devices**, look for the Linux devices you just onboarded.
