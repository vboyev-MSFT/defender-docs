# Device inventory

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr)

> Want to experience Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-machinesview-abovefoldlink)

The **Device inventory** shows a list of the devices in your network where alerts were generated. By default, the queue displays devices seen in the last 30 days. At a glance, you see information such as domain, risk level, OS platform, and other details for easy identification of devices most at risk.

> [!NOTE]
> The device inventory is available in Microsoft Defender XDR services. The available information might differ depending on your license. To get the most complete set of capabilities, use [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md).
>
> Risk Level, which can influence enforcement of Conditional Access and other security policies in Microsoft Intune, is now available for Windows devices.

There are several options you can choose from to customize the devices list view. On the top navigation you can:

- Add or remove columns.
- Export the entire list in CSV format.
- Select the number of items to show per page.
- Apply filters.

During the onboarding process, the **Devices list** is gradually populated with devices as they begin to report sensor data. Use this view to track your onboarded endpoints as they come online, or download the complete endpoint list as a CSV file for offline analysis.

> [!NOTE]
> If you export the devices list, it contains every device in your organization. It might take a significant amount of time to download, depending on how large your organization is. Exporting the list in CSV format displays the data in an unfiltered manner. The CSV file includes all devices in the organization, regardless of any filtering applied in the view itself.
>
> In addition, when you export the devices list, the antivirus status shows as `Not-Supported`. For antivirus status, use the recently released [Microsoft Defender Antivirus health report](device-health-microsoft-defender-antivirus-health.md) instead. This report allows you to export even more details.

The following image depicts the devices list:

## Sort and filter the device list

You can apply the following filters to limit the list of alerts and get a more focused view.

### Device name

During the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding process, devices onboarded to Defender for Endpoint are gradually populated into the device inventory as they begin to report sensor data. The device inventory is also populated by devices that are discovered in your network through the device discovery process. The device inventory has the following tabs:

- **All devices**
- **Computers & mobile**: Enterprise endpoints (workstations, servers, and mobile devices).
- **Network devices**: Devices like routers and switches.
- **IoT/OT devices**: Enterprise internet of things (IoT) devices like printers and cameras, and operational technology (OT) devices like servers or packaging systems.
- **Uncategorized devices**: Devices that couldn't be properly classified.

## Navigate to the Device inventory page

In the Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Assets** \> **Devices**. Or, to go directly to the **Device inventory** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/machines>.

## Device inventory overview

The device inventory opens on the **All devices** tab. You can see information such as device name, domain, risk level, exposure level, OS platform, criticality level, onboarding status, sensor health state, mitigation status, and other details for easy identification of devices most at risk.

The **Classify critical assets** card allows you to define device groups as business critical. You might also see the **Attack path warning** card, which takes you to Attack paths to examine if any of your assets are part of an attack path. For more information, see [Overview of attack paths](/security-exposure-management/work-attack-paths-overview).

> [!NOTE]
> Classify critical assets and attack path information is part of Microsoft Security Exposure Management, which is currently in public preview.

Use the **Onboarding Status** column to sort and filter by discovered devices, and devices that are already onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Image of devices list with list of devices." source="media/device-inventory.png" lightbox="media/device-inventory.png":::

From the **Network devices** and **IoT/OT devices** tabs, you also see information such as vendor, model, and device type:

:::image type="content" alt-text="Image of network devices list." source="media/device-inventory-networkdevices.png" lightbox="media/device-inventory-networkdevices.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> Device discovery integration with [Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Defender portal (Preview)](/defender-for-iot/microsoft-defender-iot) is available to help locate, identify, and secure your complete OT/IOT asset inventory. Devices discovered with this integration appear on the **IoT/OT devices** tab.
>
> With Defender for IoT, you can also view and manage Enterprise IoT devices (like printers, smart TVs, and conferencing systems) as part of enterprise IoT monitoring. For more information, see [Enable Enterprise IoT security with Defender for Endpoint](/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/eiot-defender-for-endpoint/).

At the top of each device inventory tab, the following device counts are available:

- **Total**: The total number of devices.
- **Critical assets**: The number of your business critical assets (**All devices** tab only).
- **High risk**: The number of devices that are identified as a higher risk to your organization.
- **High exposure**The number of devices with high exposure.
- **Not onboarded**: The number of devices that aren't yet onboarded. (**All devices** and **Computers & mobile** tabs only).
- **Newly discovered**: The number of newly discovered devices within the last 7 days (all tabs except **Computers & mobile**).

You can use this information to help you prioritize devices for security posture improvements.

## Explore the device inventory

There are several options to customize the device inventory view. On the top navigation for each tab you can:

- Search for a device by name.
- Search for a device by the most recently used IP or Mac address or IP address prefix.
- Add or remove columns.
- Export the entire list in CSV format for offline analysis.
- Select the date range to display.
- Apply filters.

> [!NOTE]
> If you export the device list to CSV, it contains every device in your organization, so it might take a long time to download the CSV file. The CSV file contains unfiltered data for all devices in the organization, regardless of any filters.

You can use the sort and filter functionality on each device inventory tab to get a more focused view. These controls also help you assess and manage the devices in your organization.

The counts on the top of each tab are updated based on the current view.
