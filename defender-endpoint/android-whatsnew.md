### Upgrading your experience: Upcoming enhancements you should know about

January 2025

**Key changes**

We are pleased to introduce the new dashboard for our enterprise users, which has been designed to be more user-friendly and accessible. The updated dashboard structure now includes recommendation cards for alerts and feature tiles.

Recommendation cards prominently display any active alerts, ensuring you stay informed. Additionally, features are now presented in the form of tiles, enhancing ease of use and navigation. 

The following screenshot is an example of what the user sees in their dashboard:

**Recommendation cards for alerts**

The structure of the dashboard has been updated to include a recommendation card that contains active alerts (if any). In case there are multiple alerts, resolving the top alert will bring forward the next one. Recommendation cards have been implemented to provide a more cohesive user experience. These cards are designed to display important alerts and notifications prominently on the dashboard, as shown in the following table:

| Card | Description |
|---|---|
| :::image type="content" source="media/android-whatsnew/android-connection-unsecured.png" alt-text="Screenshot of recommendation to connect to a secure network."::: | **Network protection** <br/>The user is advised to switch to a secure network. |
| :::image type="content" source="media/android-whatsnew/android-allow-vpn.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a recommendation to set up a VPN connection."::: | **VPN option** <br/>The user is prompted to set up a VPN connection on their device. |
| :::image type="content" source="media/android-whatsnew/android-threat-found.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a recommendation to take action on a detected threat."::: | **Malware detection** <br/>The user is prompted to take action on a detected threat. |

      
**Feature tiles**

The current enterprise dashboard experience now features a tile view for your security team. The following table describes tiles your security team might see.

| Tile | Description |
|---|---|
| :::image type="content" source="media/android-whatsnew/android-tile-networkprotection.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the network protection tile for security administrators."::: | **Network protection** <br/>The user can see whether a connection is secured or unsecured. |

## Android low-touch onboarding is now GA

**December 2024**

**Key benefits**

1. **Faster setup on Android devices** – Simplified Android onboarding supports silent sign-on and autogranting of certain permissions on a user's device. As such, users are required to grant only the necessary permissions to onboard to Defender for Endpoint.  

2. **Intuitive guidance** - A clear and intuitive flow to guide users through each step. 

3. **Broad coverage with support across multiple Android profiles** – Android enterprise BYOD, COPE, and fully managed. 

**Configuring low-touch onboarding** 

Although low-touch onboarding is disabled by default, security administrators can enable it through app configuration policies in Intune. See [Android low-touch onboarding](/defender-endpoint/android-intune).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Ending support for device administrator enrolled devices**
> 
> Microsoft Intune and Defender for Endpoint are ending support for device administrator enrolled devices with access to [Google Mobile Services](/mem/intune/apps/manage-without-gms) (GMS), beginning December 31, 2024.
> 
> **For devices with access to GMS**
> 
> After support ends for device administrator enrolled devices, devices with access to GMS will be affected in the following ways: 
> 
> - Intune and Defender for Endpoint won't make changes or updates to Android device administrator management, such as bug fixes, security fixes, or fixes to address changes in new Android versions.
> - Intune and Defender for Endpoint technical support will no longer support devices with access to GMS.
> 
> For more information, see [Tech Community blog: Intune ending support for Android device administrator on devices with GMS in December 2024](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/intunecustomersuccess/intune-ending-support-for-android-device-administrator-on-devices-with-gms-in-de/3915443).

## Network protection

**Aug-2024 (version: 1.0.6812.0101)**

- Network Protection feature is enabled by default for all users

Network protection on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now generally available. Network protection provides protection against rogue Wi-Fi related threats, rogue hardware like pineapple devices, and rogue certificates. It notifies the user if a related threat is detected. Users also see a guided experience to connect to secure networks and change networks when they're connected to an insecure connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This feature is now enabled by default for all users.** As a result, users will be able to see a network protection card in the Defender for Endpoint app, along with App Protection and Web Protection. Users are also required to provide location permission to complete the set up. Administrators can change the default value for network protection if they decide not to use it via the Intune App Configuration policies. 
There are also several administrator controls to offer flexibility, including privacy controls to configure the data that's sent by Defender for Endpoint from Android devices. For more information, see [network protection](android-configure.md).

## Device tagging

Mobile Device Tagging is now generally available. This feature enables bulk tagging the mobile devices by allowing the administrators to set up tags via Intune. Administrators can configure the device tags through Intune via configuration policies and push them to user's devices. Once the user installs and activates Defender, the client app passes the device tags to the Security Portal. The Device tags appear against the devices in the Device Inventory.

This configuration is available for both the enrolled (MDM) devices and unenrolled (MAM) devices. For more information, see [Device Tagging (MDM)](android-configure.md#device-tagging) and [Device Tagging (MAM)](android-configure-mam.md#device-tagging).

## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on company-owned personally enabled devices

Defender for Endpoint is now generally available on AE COPE devices. Enterprises can onboard devices on COPE mode and push Defender for Endpoint to user's devices through the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). With this support, Android Enterprise COPE devices get the full capabilities of our offering on Android, including:

- Phishing and web protection.
- Malware scanning.
- Network protection (preview).
- More breach prevention through integration with Microsoft Intune and Conditional Access.

Read the announcement [Tech Community Blog: Defender for Endpoint is now available on Android corporate-owned personally enabled devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-is-now-available-on-android/ba-p/3626100).

## Privacy controls

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android enables privacy controls for both administrators and end users, and includes controls for enrolled (MDM) and unenrolled (MAM) devices. Administrators can configure the privacy in the alert report while End Users can configure the information shared to their organization. For more information, see [privacy controls(MDM)](android-configure.md#privacy-controls) and [privacy controls (MAM)](android-configure-mam.md#configure-privacy-controls).

## Optional permissions and the ability to disable web protection

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android enables **optional permissions** in the onboarding flow. Currently the permissions required by Defender for Endpoint are mandatory in the onboarding flow. With this feature, administrators can deploy Defender for Endpoint on devices without enforcing the mandatory **VPN** and **Accessibility** permissions during onboarding. End Users can onboard the app without the mandatory permissions and can later review these permissions. This feature is currently present only for unenrolled devices (MAM). For more information, see [optional permissions](android-configure-mam.md#optional-permissions).

## Microsoft Defender on Android enterprise BYOD personal profile

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now supported on Android Enterprise personal profile (BYOD only) with all the key features including malware scanning, protection from phishing links, network protection, and vulnerability management. This support is coupled with [privacy controls](android-configure.md#privacy-controls) to ensure user privacy on personal profile. For more information, read the [announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/announcing-the-public-preview-of-defender-for-endpoint-personal/ba-p/3370979) and the [deployment guide](android-intune.md#set-up-microsoft-defender-in-personal-profile-on-android-enterprise-in-byod-mode).

## Microsoft Defender on Android app updates

Microsoft Defender is no longer supported for versions 1.0.3011.0302 or earlier. Users are requested to upgrade to latest versions to keep their devices secure.

To update, users can use the following steps:

1. On your work profile, go to Managed Play Store.

## The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app is now Microsoft Defender in the Play store
