# Deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux with Chef

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint third-party tool support](../includes/support.md)]

**Applies to**:

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Server
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/integration-defender-for-endpoint)

## Introduction

This article talks about how to deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux at scale with Chef using two methods:

1. Install using installer script
2. Manually configuring the repositories for more granular control over the deployment

## Prerequisites

For a description of prerequisites and system requirements, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux).

## Download the onboarding package

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/) then navigate to **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Device management** > **Onboarding**.

2. In the first drop-down menu, select **Linux Server** as the operating system. In the second drop-down menu, select **Your preferred Linux configuration management tool** as the deployment method.

3. Select **Download onboarding package** and save the file as `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip`.

4. Extract the contents of the archive using the following command:

   Command:
   
   ```
   unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
   ```
   
   The expected output is:
   
   ```
   Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
   inflating: mdatp_onboard.json
   ```
   
## Create a directory structure

Before you begin, ensure the Chef components are already installed and a Chef repository (chef generate repo &lt;reponame&gt;) exists to store the cookbook that's used to deploy to Defender for Endpoint on Chef-managed Linux servers.

The following command creates a new folder structure for the new cookbook called **mdatp**. You can also use an existing cookbook if you already have one you'd like to use to add the Defender for Endpoint deployment into.

```bash
chef generate cookbook mdatp
```

After the cookbook is created, create a files folder inside the cookbook folder that you created:

```bash
mkdir mdatp/files
```

Copy `mdatp_onboard.json` to the `/tmp` folder.

On the Chef Workstation, navigate to the **mdatp/recipes** folder, which is automatically created when the cookbook is generated. Use your preferred text editor (like vi or nano) to add the following instructions to the end of the **default.rb** file then save and close the file:

- include_recipe '::install_mdatp'

## Create a cookbook 

A cookbook can be created through any of the following methods:

- [Using an installer script](linux-deploy-defender-for-endpoint-with-chef.md#create-a-cookbook-using-installer-script)
- [Manually configuring repositories](linux-deploy-defender-for-endpoint-with-chef.md#create-a-cookbook-by-manually-configuring-repositories)

### Create a cookbook using installer script

1. Download the installer bash script. Pull the [installer bash script](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh) from Microsoft GitHub Repository or use the following command to download it:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/refs/heads/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh /tmp
   ```

2. Create a new recipe file named **install_mdatp.rb** in the recipes folder `~/cookbooks/mdatp/recipes/install_mdatp.rb` and add the following text to the file. You can also download the file directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/third_party_installation_playbooks/chef.install_mdatp_simplified.rb).

   ```bash
   mdatp = "/etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp"

   #Download the onboarding json from tenant, keep the same at specific location
   onboarding_json = "/tmp/mdatp_onboard.json"

   #Download the installer script from: https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh
   #Place the same at specific location, edit this if needed
   mde_installer= "/tmp/mde_installer.sh"


   ## Invoke the mde-installer script 
   bash 'Installing mdatp using mde-installer' do
       code <<-EOS
       chmod +x #{mde_installer}
       #{mde_installer} --install --onboard #{onboarding_json}
       EOS
   end
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> The installer script also supports other parameters such as channel, realtime protection, version, etc. To select from the list of available options, check help through the following command:
>```./mde_installer.sh --help```

### Create a cookbook by manually configuring repositories

Create a new recipe file named **install_mdatp.rb** in the recipes folder `~/cookbooks/mdatp/recipes/install_mdatp.rb` and add the following text to the file. You can also download the file directly from [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/third_party_installation_playbooks/chef.install_mdatp_manual.rb).

```powershell
#Add Microsoft Defender
case node['platform_family']
when 'debian'
 apt_repository 'MDATPRepo' do
   arch               'amd64'
   cache_rebuild      true
   cookbook           false
   deb_src            false
   key                'BC528686B50D79E339D3721CEB3E94ADBE1229CF'
   keyserver          "keyserver.ubuntu.com"
   distribution       'jammy'
   repo_name          'microsoft-prod'
   components         ['main']
   uri                "https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/22.04/prod"
 end
apt_package "mdatp"
when 'rhel'
 yum_repository 'microsoft-prod' do
   baseurl            "https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/7/prod/"
   description        "Microsoft Defender for Endpoint"
   enabled            true
   gpgcheck           true
   gpgkey             "https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc"
 end
 if node['platform_version'] <= 8 then
    yum_package "mdatp"
 else
    dnf_package "mdatp"
 end
end

#Create MDATP Directory
mdatp = "/etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp"
onboarding_json = "/tmp/mdatp_onboard.json"

directory "#{mdatp}" do
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode 0755
  recursive true
end

#Onboarding using tenant json 
file "#{mdatp}/mdatp_onboard.json" do
  content lazy { ::File.open(onboarding_json).read }
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0644'
  action :create_if_missing
end
```

>[!NOTE]
> You can modify the os distribution, distribution version number, channel (prod/insider-fast, insiders-slow) and repo name to match the version you're deploying to and the channel you'd like to deploy to. Run `chef-client --local-mode --runlist  'recipe[mdatp]'` to test the cookbook on the Chef workstation.

## Troubleshoot installation issues

To troubleshoot issues:

1. For information on how to find the log that's generated automatically when an installation error occurs, see [Log installation issues](linux-resources.md#log-installation-issues).

2. For information about common installation issues, see [Installation issues](/defender-endpoint/linux-support-install).

3. If the health of the device is `false`, see [Defender for Endpoint agent health issues](/defender-endpoint/health-status).

4. For product performance issues, see [Troubleshoot performance issues](/defender-endpoint/linux-support-perf).

5. For proxy and connectivity issues, see [Troubleshoot cloud connectivity issues](/defender-endpoint/linux-support-connectivity).

To get support from Microsoft, open a support ticket, and provide the log files created by using the [client analyzer](/defender-endpoint/run-analyzer-macos-linux).

## How to configure policies for Microsoft Defender on Linux

You can configure antivirus or EDR settings on your endpoints using any of the following methods:

- See [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](/defender-endpoint/linux-preferences).
- See [security settings management](/mem/intune/protect/mde-security-integration) to configure settings in the Microsoft Defender portal.

## Uninstall MDATP cookbook

To uninstall Defender, save the following as a cookbook `~/cookbooks/mdatp/recipes/uninstall_mdatp.rb`.

```powershell
#Uninstall the Defender package
case node['platform_family']
when 'debian'
 apt_package "mdatp" do
   action :remove
 end
when 'rhel'
 if node['platform_version'] <= 8
then
    yum_package "mdatp" do
      action :remove
    end
 else
    dnf_package "mdatp" do
      action :remove
    end
 end
end
```

To include this step as part of the recipe, add `include_recipe ':: uninstall_mdatp` to your `default.rb` file within the recipe folder. Ensure that you have removed the `include_recipe '::install_mdatp'` from the `default.rb` file.
